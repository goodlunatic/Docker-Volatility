Volatility profiles for Linux and Mac OS X

Each of these profiles is implemented as a zip file. You can enable them individually with your Volatility installation by copying Linux profiles to volatility/plugins/overlays/linux and Mac profiles to volatility/plugins/overlays/mac. 

NOTE: Only enable the profiles you plan to use. If you copy all zip files into the aforementioned directories, Volatility will be extremely slow to load. 

WARNING: These profiles may not be fully tested (or tested at all). Use at your own risk. If you encounter problems, please report them through the issue tracker: https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/profiles/issues.
